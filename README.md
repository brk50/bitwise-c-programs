# Bitwise C Programs - From Zero to Hero 🚀

Welcome to the ultimate bitwise playground! This repository contains a collection of C programs focused on bitwise operations — ideal for interview preparation and concept mastery.

---

## 💡 Motivation

> I created this project not just to share bitwise interview questions, but as a way to deepen my own understanding by breaking down each concept into clean, executable C programs.
>
> Bitwise operations often feel intimidating at first, but with hands-on examples and minimal, focused code, they become surprisingly intuitive.
>
> This project is my learning playground — a space where I evolve from *zero to hero* in bitwise logic — and I hope it helps others do the same. Whether you're preparing for interviews or brushing up on fundamentals, you're welcome to learn alongside me.

## 📚 Coming Soon
- Clear ith bit
- Reverse bits
- Find non-repeating element using XOR
- Add two numbers without `+` or `-`

Stay tuned and contribute if you’d like to collaborate!
